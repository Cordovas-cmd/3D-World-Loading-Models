# 3D world using models
![screen-gif](3Dmodels.gif)
Learning three js and generating a 3d simulated world with simple elements.

## Getting Started

This is a 3d ish world made with javascript and three js as well as some animation models from an open source site.

## How it Works
Use the w a s d keys to move around the zombie for now while the background figures are dancing. More work to come.
Would like to import other characters as well as a 3D generated background possibly some sort of fantasy or medieval theme.
Maybe diff Biomes.

## Built With

*Three JS
*GLT
*Javascript
*CSS
